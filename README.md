### Welcome! 🍪☕
#### About me:

- 👩‍🎓 I'm a graduate Yandex Practicum Java Developer course 2023.
- My JavaRush profile level now is <font size = "3">**26**</font> 😅 , but I'm plan to 
  reach 51 by the end of the 
  year 🎯. This year, 2023.

#### One more thing 🍏:  
```java 
  boolean isTeam 💔 = !"Me and my Brother together".equals("great team"); 
  ```  
Why it`s true? 😂 Because, [He](https://github.com/Welpodron) is front 🙂 and I am back 🙃
